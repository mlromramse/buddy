## Create the AMI

This is the command to start creation of this AMI:

	packer build debian-lxde-vnc-jmeter-master.packer.json

_The build will take a while so if you are in to coffee you are in luck, you will have ample time to brew yourself a nice cup. I would say you also have time to run down to the store and buy a bun or a cake._
